 Proxy for FastCGI

Rationale

  Some fastcgi executables, such as HHVM or php-fpm, are intended to be run as a daemon system startup. However, web servers that use fastcgi, such as Apache with mod_fcgid, expect to run a program as a sub-process to handle fastcgi traffic. 

  To allow mod_fcgid to connect to a background fastcgi daemon, I created a small proxy process. This would be something that mod_fcgid could run, and would relay the fastcgi traffic to an existing unix domain socket. 

  This proxy would ideally be very low resource usage, so the resource usage of doing it this way should be negligible under most loads..

How to build


  Simply execute "make". You will need a c++ compiler installed on your system. This will create an executable called "prox" which you can specify as your FcgidWrapper field in your apache configuration.
